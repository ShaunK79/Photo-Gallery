# Photo-Gallery
This is a Photo Gallery of African animals using CSS flexbox

This was a challenge set out for me - to create a photo gallery using CSS flexbox so my topic of choice was African Animals.

I found this challenge quite enjoyable and the final outcome was amazing.

I started off by creating html and style files and then proceeded with the challenge. 
The html boilerplate was a little different as I had to include ten X img elements. The images were in the same folder as my html, css files so this was pretty straight foward - img src="images/image.jpg" alt=""

CSS - #gallery - display, flex-direction, flex-wrap, justify-content, align-items, padding - #gallery img - width, height, object-fit ( this is something new I learnt ), padding, border-radius

*** object-fit property - The CSS object-fit property is used to specify how an <img> or <video> should be resized to fit its container.

***This property tells the content to fill the container in a variety of ways; such as "preserve that aspect ratio" or "stretch up and take up as 
   much space as possible"

To make the page responsive i set out to use media queries (@media) This is something new to me and had to 'google' (W3Schools) and find some help with this but it appears to be clear now )
